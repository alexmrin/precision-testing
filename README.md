# precision-testing
 
This repository experiments with
1. Learning how to use Weights and Biases to log training statistics
2. Using the different tensor precisions (FP32, TF32, BF16, FP16, mixed precision) and seeing how to implement each using pytorch as well as tracking training speed differences and performance dropoffs.

## How to Use

Follow these steps to get started with this project:

### Step 1: Configure `config.json`

### Step 2: Put your W&B API key into a .env file 

### Step 3: Run the training script using 
```
python train.py
```
